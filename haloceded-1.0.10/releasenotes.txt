Patch notes:
Bumped version to 1.0.10.0621
Moved Gamespy services to use new non-Gamespy server
Fixed a family of index-out-of-bounds bugs which had been exploited to crash clients
Made banlist parsing not case-sensitive
Removed halt on cache file verify error
Removed some verbose debug logging of gamespy connections
Fixed handling of video cards with >= 2GB of memory
Enabled refractive Active Camo on Nvidia cards, which had previously used an alpha fade. (AMD cards already have this)
Updated 2003-era upper bound on the video resolution picker. Use at your own risk; the game is untested at 4800x3600.
Updated chatbox settings to work with newer resolutions
Models node limit updated to 63
Fixed reading sv_ban_penalty from init.txt
Disabled executable_is_valid checksum from strings.dll

Fixed parsing of custom map names containing a "."

The Gamespy-replacement server will soon gain support for authenticating CD keys, allowing server operators to create meaningful ban files to keep out griefers (who could otherwise easily create a new online ID). This feature is still in testing and is not yet active.
